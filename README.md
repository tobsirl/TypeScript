# TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide

Type - Easy way to refer to the different porperties + functions that a value has

Why do we care about types? 
Types are used by the TypeScript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
